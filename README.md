# SecureFileStorage

## Project Description

SecureFileStorage is a decentralized smart contract built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity language. It provides a secure, encrypted file storage solution with granular access controls and decentralized key management. The system allows users to store encrypted file metadata on-chain while maintaining complete control over who can access their files and at what permission level.

The contract implements a robust access control mechanism where file owners can grant different levels of permissions (read, write, full) to other users, creating a flexible and secure file sharing ecosystem without relying on centralized authorities.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a truly decentralized file storage ecosystem that prioritizes:

- **Data Sovereignty**: Users maintain complete control over their files and access permissions
- **Privacy by Design**: All file contents are encrypted, with only metadata stored on-chain
- **Trustless Operations**: No central authority controls access - everything is governed by smart contracts
- **Interoperability**: Built on Stacks to leverage Bitcoin's security while enabling smart contract functionality
- **Scalability**: Efficient on-chain storage of metadata while keeping actual file data off-chain
- **Transparency**: All access grants and file operations are publicly auditable on the blockchain

We envision a future where individuals and organizations can securely store and share sensitive documents, intellectual property, medical records, legal documents, and other critical files without depending on centralized cloud providers that may compromise privacy or impose arbitrary restrictions.

## Future Scope

### Phase 1: Core Enhancements
- **Time-limited Access**: Implement expiring permissions with automatic revocation
- **Bulk Operations**: Enable batch file uploads and permission management
- **File Categories**: Add support for categorizing files with different security levels
- **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive logging of all file access attempts and modifications

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
- **Multi-signature Access**: Require multiple approvals for sensitive file access
- **Encrypted Sharing Keys**: Implement additional encryption layers for sharing mechanisms
- **File Versioning**: Track and manage different versions of stored files
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: Social recovery options for lost access keys
- **Integration APIs**: RESTful APIs for easy integration with existing applications

### Phase 3: Enterprise Solutions
- **Organization Management**: Support for company-wide file management and hierarchical permissions
- **Compliance Tools**: Built-in features for GDPR, HIPAA, and other regulatory compliance
- **Advanced Analytics**: Usage statistics and access pattern analysis
- **Backup and Redundancy**: Automated backup systems with multiple storage providers
- **Custom Access Policies**: Rule-based access control with complex permission logic

### Phase 4: Ecosystem Integration
- **Cross-chain Compatibility**: Support for other blockchain networks
- **DeFi Integration**: Token-based access models and monetization options
- **NFT Integration**: File ownership as tradeable NFTs
- **DAO Governance**: Community-governed platform development and policies
- **Mobile Applications**: Native iOS and Android apps for seamless file management

### Technical Roadmap
- **IPFS Integration**: Decentralized file storage backend
- **Zero-knowledge Proofs**: Enhanced privacy for file verification
- **Layer 2 Solutions**: Reduced transaction costs for frequent operations
- **AI-powered Security**: Automated threat detection and anomaly monitoring
- **Quantum-resistant Encryption**: Future-proof cryptographic algorithms

## Contract Address Details

Contract ID: ST216766CB10ZWE0N9W1V4CB4BZDT079NDKDWNRG4.Secure-File-Storage

### Deployment Information
- **Network**: Stacks Testnet4
- **Contract Address**: ST216766CB10ZWE0N9W1V4CB4BZDT079NDKDWNRG4.Secure-File-Storage
- **Deployment Transaction**: 0x8179f795fe2932e94ee8736aed8334e71a412d11ee474c7986f05a6abf187c28
- **Deployment Block**: 0xd9b523a032f0cda2e6194e0f776edac82a1ce00e360f8585579a4c55c5caf2ae
- **Contract Owner**: [To be updated]

### Usage Instructions

1. **Storing Files**: Use the `store-file` function with your file ID, encrypted hash, access key, and file size
2. **Granting Access**: File owners can use `grant-file-access` to share files with specific permission levels
3. **Checking Access**: Use read-only functions to verify permissions and retrieve file information

### Security Considerations

- All file contents should be encrypted client-side before generating the hash
- Access keys should be generated using cryptographically secure methods
- File IDs should be unique and unpredictable to prevent unauthorized discovery
- Regular audits of access permissions are recommended for sensitive files
